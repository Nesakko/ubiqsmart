## Predictable. Consistent. Stable.

Ubiq is built upon an improved version of the Ethereum Codebase, putting stability at its core. Ubiq offers an enterprise-stable platform by implementing well established and thoroughly tested EVM code. This code, coupled with a conservative upgrade schedule, reduces the risk of network instability and unintended hard-forks. As a result, Ubiq has never experienced a 51% nor had any `social interventions` breaking immutability. 

## Community Governed.

Just as Ubiq is permissionless open-source software, Ubiq's governance system `Escher` democratizes the direction of the platform's development by providing users an on-chain vote. Important proposal decisions are entrusted to the community at-large through transparent, verifiable, immutable public voting.

## Efficient & Reliable.

In an [independent benchmark](https://www.whiteblock.io/library/ubiq-report.pdf) it was found that given the same hashrate, Ubiq has **90%** fewer uncles than Ethereum, leading to greater chain security, improving the reliability of the network. It was also found that Ubiq's transactional throughput per second is **2x that of Ethereum's at a 40million block gas limit**.

## Fair Launch

Ubiq launched in 2017 without an ICO, premine, or dev fee, aligning developer incentives with the long term success of the project. This helps ensure decentralization always comes first as centralized sources of funding are unable to hijack the protocol.

Ubiq's distribution mechanism and lack of ICO funding also insulates the network from the uncertainty of regulatory compliance regarding securities. As an independent, fair-launch blockchain network, Ubiq has the flexibility to offer solutions to users in a wide variety of regulatory environments.

## Open-source Collaboration

All of Ubiq's code is Open-Source, available for the community and interested developers to collaborate and build upon. Ubiq is entirely community driven, from development to marketing and open for anyone to participate. Our members dedicate their time to helping people with issues, informing our users of the latest updates and building cool stuff that utilizes the platform.

## Stable Monetary Policy

Ubiq's monetary policy was hard-coded at its genesis, meaning fewer surprises for the future. A predictable inflationary control system with longevity in mind helps strike a balance between simulating scarcity and incentivizing miners to secure the network. Much like Bitcoin, Ubiqs monetary policy has not been altered since launch.
