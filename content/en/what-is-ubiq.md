## Predictable. Consistent. Stable

Built upon an improved version of the Ethereum Codebase, Ubiq offers an enterprise-stable proof-of-work platform by implementing well-established and thoroughly tested EVM code. This code, coupled with a conservative upgrade schedule, significantly reduces the risk of network instability and unintended hard-forks. As a result, Ubiq has never experienced a 51% attack nor any social interventions that break immutability.

## Efficient & Reliable

An [independent performance benchmark analysis](https://www.whiteblock.io/library/ubiq-report.pdf) determined that given the same hashrate, Ubiq has 90% fewer uncles than Ethereum, leading to both greater chain security  and  network reliability. In addition, Ubiq's transactional throughput per second is 2x that of Ethereum's at a 40 million block gas limit.

## Fair Launch

Ubiq launched in 2017 without an ICO, pre-mine, or developer fee, aligning developer incentives with long-term success of the project. This helps ensure true decentralization.
Ubiq's distribution mechanism and lack of ICO funding also insulates the network from the uncertainty of regulatory compliance regarding securities. As an independent, fair-launch blockchain network, Ubiq has the flexibility to offer solutions to users in a wide variety of regulatory environments.

## Open-Source Collaboration

All of Ubiq's code is open-source and available to the community. Developers can collaborate and build upon existing code. Ubiq is entirely community-driven, from development to marketing, and open for anyone to participate. All development on Ubiq thus far has entirely been on a voluntary basis.

## Stable Monetary Policy

Ubiq's strict monetary policy means fewer surprises in the future. A predictable inflationary control system with longevity in mind helps strike a balance between simulating scarcity and incentivizing miners to secure the network.

## Community-Governed

Just as Ubiq is permissionless open-source software, Ubiq's governance system, Escher, democratizes the platform's development by giving users the ability to cast on-chain votes. Proposal decisions are entrusted to the community at-large through transparent, verifiable, and immutable public voting.
