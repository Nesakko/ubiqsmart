## Ubqhash

Originally launched with Ethash, Ubiq changed to Ubqhash after UIP1 reached 97.5% consensus via our governance system. You can mine UBQ using any mining software that supports Ubqhash, such as:

* [Ubqminer](https://github.com/ubiq/ubqminer/releases)
* [PhoenixMiner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2647654.msg48314178#msg48314178)
* [SMOS](https://simplemining.net/)
* [HiveOS](https://hiveos.farm/)

## DAG Growth

Ubiq's slower DAG growth means older GPUs are supported for much longer than other popular proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. You can still mine Ubiq with a 2GB GPU and will be able to for a long time. This lowers the barrier to entry by allowing older cards to participate.
