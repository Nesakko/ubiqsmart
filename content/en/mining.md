## Ubqhash

Originally launching with Ethash, Ubiq changed to Ubqhash after UIP1 reached 97.5% consensus via our governance system 'Escher'. You can mine UBQ using any mining software that supports ubqhash, such as:

* [Ubqminer](https://github.com/ubiq/ubqminer/releases)
* [PhoenixMiner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2647654.msg48314178#msg48314178)
* [SMOS](https://simplemining.net/)
* [HiveOS](https://hiveos.farm/)

## DAG Growth

Ubiq's slower DAG growth means older GPUs are supported for much longer. You can still mine Ubiq with a 2GB GPU, and will be able to for quite some time. This lowers the barrier to entry by allowing older cards to participate, and gives miners more time to ROI on their hardware before it's obsolete.
