title: What is UBQ?
description: UBQ is the native cryptocurrency on the Ubiq network. It is scarce digital money that you can use on the internet – similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you’re new to crypto, here's how UBQ is different from traditional money.

## It's really yours

With UBQ, you can be your own bank. You control your own funds with your wallet as proof of ownership. No third party intermediaries required.

## Secured by cryptography

Internet money may be new but it's secured by proven cryptography. This protects your wallet, your UBQ, and your transactions. 

## Peer-to-peer payments

You can send your UBQ without any intermediary service like a bank. It's like handing cash over in-person, but you can do it securely with anyone, anywhere, anytime.

## No centralized control

UBQ is decentralized and global. There's no company or bank that can decide to print more UBQ, or change the terms of use. UBQ has had a strict monetary policy hard-coded since inception.

## Open to anyone

You only need an internet connection and a wallet to accept UBQ. You don't need access to a bank account to accept payments. If you have spare GPUs (2GB+) you can mine UBQ without anyones permission.

## Available in flexible amounts

UBQ is divisible up to 18 decimal places so you don't have to buy 1 whole UBQ. You can buy fractions at a time – as little as 0.000000000000000001 UBQ if you want.

## UBQ fuels and secures Ubiq

UBQ is the lifeblood of Ubiq. When you send UBQ, tokens or use a Ubiq application, you'll pay a small fee in UBQ to use the Ubiq network. This fee is an incentive for a miner to process and verify what you're trying to do. Miners are like the record-keepers of Ubiq – they check and prove that no one is cheating. Miners who do this work are also rewarded with small amounts of newly-issued UBQ.
The work miners do keeps Ubiq secure and free of centralized control. In other words, UBQ powers Ubiq.

## UBQ underpins the Ubiq financial system

Not satisfied with payments, the Ubiq community is building a whole financial system that's peer-to-peer and accessible to everyone.
You can use UBQ as collateral to generate entirely different cryptocurrency tokens on Ubiq.

## Uses for UBQ grow every day

Because Ubiq is programmable, developers can shape UBQ in countless ways.
Back in 2017, all you could do was send UBQ from one Ubiq account to another. Here are just some of things you can do today. 

* [Shinobi](https://shinobi-info.ubiq.ninja) - decentralized exchange protocol
* [Enmaku](https://ubiq.enamaku.io) - decentralized privacy protocol 
* [Poster Shop](https://poster.ubiqsmart.com/) - physically redeemable NFTs
* [Liquidity Mining](https://tge1.ubiqsmart.com/) - provide liquidity to mine new Ubiq backed tokens
