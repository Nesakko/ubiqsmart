## Truly Yours

You can be your own bank with UBQ. You’re the only one in control of your funds. All you need is a wallet. Nothing else.

## Cryptography Keeps Your UBQ Secure

UBQ is secured by proven cryptography, thereby keeping your wallet, UBQ and all transactions completely safe.

## Peer-to-Peer Transactions

You can send UBQ to anyone - anytime, anywhere. There is no need for third parties or intermediaries.

## Fully Decentralized

UBQ is completely decentralized, meaning there is no centralized company or bank in control. UBQ’s strict monetary policy was hard-coded at inception. However, improvement proposals can be made via Ubiq’s Escher governance system.

## Open To All

All you need is an internet connection and a wallet to accept UBQ. You don't need access to a bank account to accept payments. If you have spare GPUs (2GB+), you can mine UBQ without the need for permission.

## Available In Virtually Any Amount

UBQ is divisible by up to 18 decimal places, so you could buy as little as 0.000000000000000001 UBQ.

## UBQ Fuels and Secures Ubiq

UBQ is the cornerstone of Ubiq. When you send UBQ, Ubiq-based tokens, or use a Ubiq application, you pay a small fee in UBQ. This fee incentivizes miners to process and verify your transaction. This, along with newly-issued UBQ in the form of block rewards, is how miners are contracted by the protocol to secure the network, ensuring Ubiq is free from centralized control. 

## UBQ Underpins the Ubiq Financial System

The Ubiq community is building an entire peer-to-peer financial system that is accessible to everyone.
You can use UBQ as collateral to generate new tokens on Ubiq.
