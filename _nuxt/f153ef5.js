In order to send a transaction on Ubiq or Ethereum, you need UBQ or ETH for gas. So if the gas for a withdrawal is linked to you, then so is the withdrawal itself.</p><p>This raises an obvious problem: you need private gas money to initiate a withdrawal, but you need an Enmaku withdrawal to get that private gas money. This catch-22 is resolved with relayers.</p><p>Relayers are services run by others for a fee that initiate a withdrawal on your behalf when you don’t have the private gas to initiate it yourself. If you have an empty wallet and some deposits to withdraw, you’d use a relayer to withdraw some UBQ deposits for gas, so you can use a wallet to withdraw your remaining deposits.</p><h4>Relayer Select</h4><p>You can open Relayer Select View by clicking on the Change button next to Relayer: <strong>None</strong>.</p><p><em>The default relayer each time the app starts is None, which means your wallet will initiate the withdrawal. You must manually change this each time the app starts to prevent any network calls outside the host and RPC without you explicitly initiating them.</em></p><p>You’ll see a list of relayers and their URLs.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6N1U4yki98bjbVeA4wzCNQ.png\\" /></figure><p><em>Each relayer’s status can be found at its base URL and contains information regarding fees, gas price, supported tokens, and version.</em></p><p>To ping a cell and fetch its status data, you can click on the relayer’s cell. You can also click “Batch ping all” to fetch them all and sort by fee.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*p-e1MEWAG2ehBQ0EoBFi2A.png\\" /></figure><p>In the upper right hand corner, you’ll see the relayer’s Supported Tokens. You can also hover over the token icon to reveal which specific pools are supported.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/1*Kv0d32abfVeX8zT1tHpIBg.png\\" /></figure><p>In the lower half of the cell, you’ll find the relayer’s base fee percentage and gas price for each withdrawal.</p><p><em>Because gas is a constant and fee percentage is a scalar, the “cheapest” relayer will depend on which amounts are being withdrawn.</em></p><p><em>For example, if a relayer’s gas price is 0.01 UBQ and its fee is 1%, a 1000 UBQ withdrawal will end up costing 10.01 UBQ (1.001%) while a 10 UBQ withdrawal will cost .11 UBQ (1.1%).</em></p><p><em>Since the amount distribution of your notes can affect which relayer is cheapest, after you’ve validated some notes, you’ll find additional fee calculations for your withdrawal in the cell too, and relayers will then be sorted by those.</em></p><p>Once you’ve selected a relayer, click on the back button to return to Withdrawal.</p><p><strong>Note Validation</strong></p><p>Back in Withdrawal, enter a few notes you used to deposit UBQ into the input panel.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7ogwCAsISwe1RaW9K5p9Vg.png\\" /></figure><p>Click on the validate button, and Enmaku will ensure the notes are valid and in the pool.</p><p><em>When Enmaku validates your notes, it first checks that each note’s format is correct, then fetches a list of all the pool’s past deposit events to find yours. This is for two reasons. 1: When Enmaku generates the withdrawal proof using the note, it needs to construct the deposit’s Merkle tree to find the path, so all the deposits are required. 2: If you only fetch your* note’s deposit with an external RPC, the RPC can know which deposit is yours when you do anything with it. The entire event history is retrieved every time, not just when withdrawing, for these reasons.</em></p><p>The first time you validate a pool’s note, it may take a while to download the event history, but since that history is then cached in the browser, subsequent downloads will be much faster.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EBwo-z7fhomILsBm3pvt9A.png\\" /></figure><p>You should see a status of <strong>[Found in pool]</strong> for your notes, but if you don’t, it’ll be for 1 of 7 reasons:</p><ul><li>Wrong token: Enmaku will only withdraw one token at a time. The selected ‘withdrawal token’ corresponds with the first valid note in your list. If you attempt to validate a valid UBQ and a valid ESCH note in that order, the ESCH note will show [Wrong token], and you’ll need to withdraw it in a separate withdrawal.</li><li>Invalid note format: The note didn’t pass the regex and is incorrectly formatted.

In order to send a transaction on Ubiq or Ethereum, you need UBQ or ETH for gas. So if the gas for a withdrawal is linked to you, then so is the withdrawal itself.\\nThis raises an obvious problem: you need private gas money to initiate a withdrawal, but you need an Enmaku withdrawal to get that private gas money. This catch-22 is resolved with relayers.\\nRelayers are services run by others for a fee that initiate a withdrawal on your behalf when you don’t have the private gas to initiate it yourself. If you have an empty wallet and some deposits to withdraw, you’d use a relayer to withdraw some UBQ deposits for gas, so you can use a wallet to withdraw your remaining deposits.\\nRelayer Select\\nYou can open Relayer Select View by clicking on the Change button next to Relayer: None.\\nThe default relayer each time the app starts is None, which means your wallet will initiate the withdrawal. You must manually change this each time the app starts to prevent any network calls outside the host and RPC without you explicitly initiating them.\\nYou’ll see a list of relayers and their URLs.\\n\\nEach relayer’s status can be found at its base URL and contains information regarding fees, gas price, supported tokens, and version.\\nTo ping a cell and fetch its status data, you can click on the relayer’s cell. You can also click “Batch ping all” to fetch them all and sort by fee.\\n\\nIn the upper right hand corner, you’ll see the relayer’s Supported Tokens. You can also hover over the token icon to reveal which specific pools are supported.\\n\\nIn the lower half of the cell, you’ll find the relayer’s base fee percentage and gas price for each withdrawal.\\nBecause gas is a constant and fee percentage is a scalar, the “cheapest” relayer will depend on which amounts are being withdrawn.\\nFor example, if a relayer’s gas price is 0.01 UBQ and its fee is 1%, a 1000 UBQ withdrawal will end up costing 10.01 UBQ (1.001%) while a 10 UBQ withdrawal will cost .11 UBQ (1.1%).\\nSince the amount distribution of your notes can affect which relayer is cheapest, after you’ve validated some notes, you’ll find additional fee calculations for your withdrawal in the cell too, and relayers will then be sorted by those.\\nOnce you’ve selected a relayer, click on the back button to return to Withdrawal.\\nNote Validation\\nBack in Withdrawal, enter a few notes you used to deposit UBQ into the input panel.\\n\\nClick on the validate button, and Enmaku will ensure the notes are valid and in the pool.\\nWhen Enmaku validates your notes, it first checks that each note’s format is correct, then fetches a list of all the pool’s past deposit events to find yours. This is for two reasons. 1: When Enmaku generates the withdrawal proof using the note, it needs to construct the deposit’s Merkle tree to find the path, so all the deposits are required. 2: If you only fetch your* note’s deposit with an external RPC, the RPC can know which deposit is yours when you do anything with it. The entire event history is retrieved every time, not just when withdrawing, for these reasons.\\nThe first time you validate a pool’s note, it may take a while to download the event history, but since that history is then cached in the browser, subsequent downloads will be much faster.\\n\\nYou should see a status of [Found in pool] for your notes, but if you don’t, it’ll be for 1 of 7 reasons:\\n\\nWrong token: Enmaku will only withdraw one token at a time. The selected ‘withdrawal token’ corresponds with the first valid note in your list. If you attempt to validate a valid UBQ and a valid ESCH note in that order, the ESCH note will show [Wrong token], and you’ll need to withdraw it in a separate withdrawal.\\nInvalid note format: The note didn’t pass the regex and is incorrectly formatted. Ensure the note is entered exactly how Enmaku first displayed it.\\nUnsupported token: The token symbol wasn’t found in the app, and you may need to add it.\\nUnsupported amount: The token symbol was found in the app, but the pool’s amount was not.\\nWrong chain ID: The note’s chain ID is incorrect, and you may be using the wrong interface.\\nNever deposited: The note’s format is fine, but its associated deposit was not found in the pool.\\nAlready withdrawn: The note has been spent.\\n\\nIf you selected a relayer and validated some notes, you’ll notice a drop card under the Withdraw card, displaying exactly how much will go to the relayer. These numbers are based on the gas price and fee for your valid notes’ amount distribution.\\nOut of 4 UBQ, 3.9 will be withdrawn to you, and the remaining 0.1 will be sent to the relayer for fee and gas\\nClick on the relayer’s change button again to view the relayer cells.\\n\\nThe bottom half now also has the total percentage fee for your withdrawal as well as how many & which of your withdrawals are supported by the relayer.\\nAs with supported tokens, you can hover over “Total Supported Withdrawals” to view which of yours are supported.\\n\\nFor the sake of explanation, we selected a relayer before validating our notes, but bear in mind that Enmaku will sort relayers by whichever is cheapest given all the information it has, including validated notes.\\nSo if you’re using a relayer, it makes more sense to validate your notes, then ping relayers to choose the cheapest from there.\\nRelayer Withdrawal\\nFinally, create a new account in Sparrow or MetaMask and copy the address.\\n\\nPaste the address into the destination field.\\n\\nClick on withdraw. A confirmation modal will open.\\n\\nOnce you confirm your withdrawal, your notes will be used to compute proofs that demonstrate you’re entitled to your original deposits.\\n\\nTo keep on-chain verification costs low, proof generation requires more computation off-chain, so it may take up to ~10 seconds to generate each note’s proof.\\nAs proofs are generated, they’ll be sent to the relayer, and you will receive transaction hashes if they were successful.\\n\\nAnd once again, just as with the deposit, we can click on “Complete this withdrawal” in the modal to clear the withdrawal session.\\n\\nOnce they’re confirmed, you’ll see your updated balance in your wallet, minus the relayer fee and gas costs.\\n\\nWallet Withdrawal\\nNow that we’ve used a relayer to withdraw private UBQ for gas, we can use that UBQ to wallet-withdraw our remaining notes!

If you choose to do this, Enmaku will keep your notes in local storage, and they’ll be manageable in the Notes page.

Each time a new block is </em><strong><em>found</em></strong><em>, it propagates updates to the rest of the app, including pending transactions to check whether or not they’ve been confirmed or rejected.</em></p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TnqXFLDtYKK957qP5oweaw.png\\" /></figure><p>To clear your deposit session, click the “Complete this deposit” button and the modal will close. You can also click on the X or outside the modal to close it without clearing your session.</p><p>Notice at the top, the wallet status button now shows there are transactions pending.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/648/1*LBDBNOHL2Gs9rL1vkbjPdQ.png\\" /></figure><p>You can view these by clicking on the button to open the wallet modal.

They DO NOT store the note. If you select “Yes” to saving notes in the confirm modal, they’re separately contained and manageable in the Notes page, so clearing these will not affect saved notes. The reasons for this are covered in detail in Part 4: Managing Notes.</em></p><p>Once the transactions are confirmed, your UBQ will have been successfully deposited into the pool!</p><h3><strong>Depositing ESCH</strong></h3><p>Enmaku also allows you to deposit ERC20 tokens. In this demo, we’ll be using Escher (ESCH), Ubiq’s official governance token. If you don’t have any ESCH, you can trade your UBQ for it using Ubiq’s <a href=\\"https://shinobi.ubiq.ninja\\">Shinobi DEX</a>. Be sure to leave enough UBQ to pay for deposit gas.</p><p>After your wallet is connected and funded with ESCH, enter an amount you’d like to deposit. This time, since the smallest denomination is 10, you’ll need to deposit a multiple of that. You’ll notice when you type an amount, the total in the summary will be the largest amount that can be deposited. If you enter 88, it will be floored to 80, and when you finish entering the amount, the number in the input field will change as well.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qXd7q5rpvc3cYGHcqLzt9w.png\\" /></figure><p>In this example, we’ll deposit 20 ESCH. As with UBQ, enter the amount, and click on Deposit to open the confirm modal. Again, you’ll receive notes.</p><figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*245uy4VRZq3EXeocN2mIBw.png\\" /></figure><p>Save your notes, then confirm you’ve backed them up.</p><p>You’ll notice that the modal summary has an extra field in it this time — Approval Transactions — this is the only difference between UBQ and ERC20 deposits. In order to deposit ERC20 tokens, you must first approve the transfer of the tokens to the pool you’re depositing into.</p><p>So for each pool being used, Enmaku sums up the total amount going to that pool and adds its approval transaction to the front of your deposit transaction batch.

You’ll need a browser extension wallet (Sparrow or MetaMask) installed.\\nSparrow is Ubiq’s privacy-focused MetaMask fork and is recommended for this demo. If you’d rather use MetaMask, you can add Ubiq to MetaMask with this guide, and it’ll function in the same way.\\nOnce your wallet is installed and funded with UBQ, launch Enmaku and the root will redirect to the deposit page.\\n\\nAs with Uniswap and Shinobi, you can click on the selected token in the amount section to change the deposit token.\\n\\nWe’ll stick with UBQ for now.\\nConnect your wallet\\nTo the top-right of the interface, click Connect to a wallet to connect Enmaku to Sparrow or MetaMask.\\n\\nEntering your deposit amounts\\nEach pool has a specific amount that can be deposited into it since there’s no way to withdraw a unique amount that wouldn’t reveal the original deposit.\\nTo circumvent having to choose a specific amount, Enmaku’s interface allows you to enter any deposit amount you’d like, and computes the pool distribution that will yield the least number of total deposits for it.\\nIf we enter 852, the app will calculate that eight 100s, five 10s, and two 1s will yield the smallest number of total deposits for that amount, 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 deposit transactions.\\n\\nIf you’d like to change the distribution, you can use the pool arrow.\\nIf we lower 10’s pool by 1 deposit and raise 1’s pool by 10 deposits, the amount will remain 852 UBQ, but the transaction count is now up to 24 from 15.\\n\\nTo recompute optimal denominations, you can click the green arrow between the amount and pools.\\nMake your deposit\\nFor the demo, we’ll just deposit 8 UBQ.\\n\\nEnter the amount and click Deposit 8 UBQ to open the confirmation modal, and you’ll see the notes Enmaku generated for your deposits.\\n\\nThese notes are the keys to your withdrawals and linking them to their original deposits. If you lose them, there will be no way to retrieve your funds. If the notes are stolen and used, your funds will be gone forever. If they’re taken later, they can be used to link your deposits to your withdrawals.\\nBottom line: Treat them like your private keys and store them securely.\\nCopy your notes and back them up. Once you confirm that you’ve backed up your notes, the button to confirm your deposit will be revealed.\\n\\nNotice in the modal summary, you have the option to save your notes in the browser. If you choose to do this, Enmaku will keep your notes in local storage, and they’ll be manageable in the Notes page. For the demo, we’ll switch it to Yes and continue.\\nOnce you click Confirm Deposit, Enmaku will hash each note to prepare the deposit, wrap all the deposits in a transaction batch, then open your wallet so you can confirm each deposit’s transaction.\\n\\nAfter you’ve confirmed all the transactions, Enmaku will add them to its pending cache and you’ll be able to see their statuses in both the deposit and wallet modals.\\nAs mentioned, Enmaku polls for a new block every 8 seconds. Each time a new block is found, it propagates updates to the rest of the app, including pending transactions to check whether or not they’ve been confirmed or rejected.\\n\\nTo clear your deposit session, click the “Complete this deposit” button and the modal will close. You can also click on the X or outside the modal to close it without clearing your session.\\nNotice at the top, the wallet status button now shows there are transactions pending.\\n\\nYou can view these by clicking on the button to open the wallet modal. Again, these will be updated as new blocks are found and can be removed from Enmaku’s cache with the (clear all) button to the top-right of the list.\\n\\nThese transactions are automatically cleared after 24 hours.\\nIt’s worth mentioning that these cached transactions only store the transaction hash, event type, and amount if applicable. They DO NOT store the note. If you select “Yes” to saving notes in the confirm modal, they’re separately contained and manageable in the Notes page, so clearing these will not affect saved notes. The reasons for this are covered in detail in Part 4: Managing Notes.\\nOnce the transactions are confirmed, your UBQ will have been successfully deposited into the pool!\\nDepositing ESCH\\nEnmaku also allows you to deposit ERC20 tokens. In this demo, we’ll be using Escher (ESCH), Ubiq’s official governance token. If you don’t have any ESCH, you can trade your UBQ for it using Ubiq’s Shinobi DEX. Be sure to leave enough UBQ to pay for deposit gas.\\nAfter your wallet is connected and funded with ESCH, enter an amount you’d like to deposit. This time, since the smallest denomination is 10, you’ll need to deposit a multiple of that. You’ll notice when you type an amount, the total in the summary will be the largest amount that can be deposited. If you enter 88, it will be floored to 80, and when you finish entering the amount, the number in the input field will change as well.\\n\\nIn this example, we’ll deposit 20 ESCH. As with UBQ, enter the amount, and click on Deposit to open the confirm modal. Again, you’ll receive notes.\\n\\nSave your notes, then confirm you’ve backed them up.\\nYou’ll notice that the modal summary has an extra field in it this time — Approval Transactions — this is the only difference between UBQ and ERC20 deposits. In order to deposit ERC20 tokens, you must first approve the transfer of the tokens to the pool you’re depositing into.\\nSo for each pool being used, Enmaku sums up the total amount going to that pool and adds its approval transaction to the front of your deposit transaction batch. For example, if you’re making 8 deposit transactions into 3 pools, your total transaction count will be the 3 approvals + 8 deposits = 11 transactions.\\nSince we’re making 2 deposits into 1 pool, we’ll see 3 transactions, and the first will be to approve 20 ESCH. Once again, when you click confirm, your notes will be hashed and batched together, and the wallet’s confirmation window will open.\\n\\nRemember that the order is important here: approvals must be confirmed before the deposits or the deposits will fail.\\nAfter you confirm the transactions, as with UBQ, the deposits are added to your transaction cache, and again, you can complete your deposit to clear your session to start over.\\n\\nIn the next post, we’ll go through privately withdrawing these deposits.\\nThanks for checking in and be sure to follow the blog, Twitter, Github and join Ubiq Discord to help collaborate with the best community on the internet.\\nUbiq Discord: https://discord.gg/XaqzJB4\\nMedium blog: https://blog.ubiqsmart.com\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ubiqsmart\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CryptoUbiq (Ubiq Community)\\nGitHub: https://github.com/ubiq\\nWebsite: http://ubiqsmart.com\\n\\nEnmaku (3/6) Making Deposits was originally published in The Ubiq Report on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"JP88","guid":"https://medium.com/p/c64ce477b2d","categories":["tutorial","ethereum","enmaku","privacy","tornadocash"],"isoDate":"2021-05-28T15:16:56.000Z","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TruyyVRCc-kco7cLVUzr1Q.png"},{"creator":"JP88","title":"Enmaku (2/6) Settings and Privacy","link":"https://blog.ubiqsmart.com/enmaku-2-6-settings-and-privacy-5cb8a2a3fd57?source=rss----e1e26a9bebc8---4","pubDate":"Fri, 28 May 2021 15:16:19 GMT","content:encoded":"<figure><img alt=\\"\\" src=\\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TruyyVRCc-kco7cLVUzr1Q.png\\" /></figure><p><em>The previous post briefly summarized what Enmaku is and how it works: a non-custodial contract pools together tokens that can be privately withdrawn later by its original depositors.</em></p><p><em>Let’s now dive into settings and the network requests the app makes to preserve your privacy.</em></p><p>Throughout the Enmaku interface, where a majority of users will interact with the contracts, there are 4 types of network requests that can be made:</p><ol><li><strong>Host </strong>— you will, of course, need the interface being used, and it’ll need to fetch pages and resources from where it’s hosted: <a href=\\"https://github.com/enmakuio/ubiq\\">Github Pages</a>. <em>If you’d like to run the app locally, you can also clone its repo and initiate a local server.</em></li><li><strong>App’s RPC provider</strong> — this is used for block polling, validating withdrawals, updating saved note statuses, running compliance, and importing notes.

If you want a short summary and don’t care about specifics or what’s happening under the hood, this is for you 😊\\nEnmaku (2/6) App and Settings\\nIn this part, we dive into the app & settings and how they affect your privacy. We’ll also go through all the network requests the app makes so you can understand when your privacy is likely to be compromised and how you can prevent it.\\nEnmaku (3/6) Making Deposits\\nIn this part, we go into making deposits for Base & ERC20 tokens, along with the purpose that notes serve and how to properly secure them.\\nEnmaku (4/6) Making Withdrawals\\nIn this part, we’ll learn all about relayers, and use our deposit notes to privately withdraw our funds with both relayers and wallets.\\nEnmaku (5/6) Managing notes\\nIn this part, we’ll talk about how Enmaku manages your saved notes and what you can do with them.\\nEnmaku (6/6) Privacy tips and final notes\\nIn this part, we’ll finish off with some general privacy tips and tricks.\\nTornado Cash & Enmaku\\nBlockchains are transparent by design because every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, and while this is great for transparency, it’s a nightmare for privacy because it means every transaction can be traced. Enter Tornado Cash.\\nTornado Cash Interface\\nTornado Cash is a well-known project on Ethereum for good reason: they were the first to bring layer 2 privacy from mere research to production.\\nThey achieved this privacy by creating non-custodial shared-pool contracts that users deposit funds into and then withdraw those funds from, without the withdrawals being linked to the original deposits. This, in turn, breaks the traceable path, and the result is financial privacy on a public EVM chain.\\nEnmaku is a protocol built using Tornado’s core contracts thereby enabling private transactions on Ubiq.\\nEnmaku’s contracts use the same zk-snarks keys generated by Tornado Cash’s trusted setup ceremony with 1114 contributors.
