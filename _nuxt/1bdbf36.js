With your staked SLPT you can earn your yield in a brand new token, which has its own individual purpose and market. The new token has an issuance model which we will explain when launched, but will be rewarded to participants staking their SLPT each block that passes.</p><p>Ubiq is currently planning to launch several of these incentives in 2021.

This is a potential way to mitigate the risk of Impermanent Loss and increase liquidity and price stability to a trading pair\\nThe concept of Impermanent Loss has been covered in previous guides, and we recommend reading through these to familiarize yourself before taking advantage of a yield farming opportunity.\\nToken Generation Events or TGEs are one way of providing an opportunity to farm yield. With your staked SLPT you can earn your yield in a brand new token, which has its own individual purpose and market. The new token has an issuance model which we will explain when launched, but will be rewarded to participants staking their SLPT each block that passes.\\nUbiq is currently planning to launch several of these incentives in 2021. In preparation, we recommend the community spends some time reading this guide.\\nHow to farm yield on Ubiq\\nThe first step to farming yield is to provide liquidity to a pairing on Shinobi.

Years of evaluating various codes and protocols led the core development team to pursuing an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible network that included improvements to the monetary policy, DAG growth, block times, and distribution model. Ubiq was launched without a premine and did not ICO, providing an equal opportunity for all to enter into the decentralized proof of work (PoW) platform. The intention was to provide a more stable alternative to Ethereum with various improvements. As you read below, note that the Gubiq updates follow the upstream Geth updates after the changes have gone auditing and testing by the core Ubiq development team. Ubiq has remained lock-step with Ethereum in it’s core network development with an update coming in the next few days.</p><p>There are quite a few articles posted by community members chronicling the developments and events involving Ubiq over the last 4 years. Listed below are the major network and core infrastructure developments that have occurred over the last 4 years:</p><p><strong>Year 1 - 2017</strong></p><ul><li>Genesis Block, Fusion Wallet, Mining support</li><li>Partnerships with Einstein and Cryptopia exchanges</li><li>Pyrus Introduced — Offline wallet</li><li>Sparrow Released — MetaMask Fork</li><li>Ubiq named 2017 Canadian Blockchain Company of the Year</li><li>Inflation 7.29% with Mining Reward per block at 8</li></ul><p><strong>Year 2 - 2018</strong></p><ul><li>Gubiq 1.5.14 updated</li><li>Governance Released — Escher token announced with 8 airdrops</li><li>Escher Airdrops 1 and 2</li><li>Whiteblock study — TL;DR Ubiq had 2X increase in throughput and 90% lower uncle rate.</li><li>First Ubiq Improvement Proposal, UIP 1 — Vote to hard fork to change to Ubqhash to mitigate 51% attack.</li><li>Inflation 6.00% with Mining Reward per block at 7</li></ul><p><strong>Year 3 - 2019</strong></p><ul><li>Octano Labs Introduced-EVM support with Ubiq focus</li><li>Escher Airdrops 3, 4, 5 and 6</li><li>Gubiq updates 2.1, 2.2, 2.3</li><li>Andromeda Hard Fork</li><li>Inflation 4.89% with Mining Reward per block at 6</li></ul><p><strong>Year 4 - 2020</strong></p><ul><li>Gubiq updates 3.1, 3.2</li><li>Tornado Cash implementation</li><li>Escher Airdrops 7, and 8</li><li>UIP voted to disable Escher minting.

To assist with broadening the market reach, there will be a bridge to Ethereum so that a market on Uniswap can be created. Ubiq coins will be wrapped and tokenized as wUbq and paired up with Eth, creating a wUbq/Eth market. A Dai bridge is also being evaluated so that funds can port over from various markets and wallets.</p><p>To encourage liquidity growth on Shinobi, there will be <a href=\\"https://blog.ubiqsmart.com/launch-of-the-ubiq-token-generation-event-framework-842bd50274cd\\"><strong><em>Token Generating Events (TGEs)</em></strong></a> that will give Ubq/Esch liquidity providers tokens for the dApps being launched on the network by the core development team.

Years of evaluating various codes and protocols led the core development team to pursuing an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible network that included improvements to the monetary policy, DAG growth, block times, and distribution model. Ubiq was launched without a premine and did not ICO, providing an equal opportunity for all to enter into the decentralized proof of work (PoW) platform. The intention was to provide a more stable alternative to Ethereum with various improvements. As you read below, note that the Gubiq updates follow the upstream Geth updates after the changes have gone auditing and testing by the core Ubiq development team. Ubiq has remained lock-step with Ethereum in it’s core network development with an update coming in the next few days.\\nThere are quite a few articles posted by community members chronicling the developments and events involving Ubiq over the last 4 years. Listed below are the major network and core infrastructure developments that have occurred over the last 4 years:\\nYear 1 - 2017\\n\\nGenesis Block, Fusion Wallet, Mining support\\nPartnerships with Einstein and Cryptopia exchanges\\nPyrus Introduced — Offline wallet\\nSparrow Released — MetaMask Fork\\nUbiq named 2017 Canadian Blockchain Company of the Year\\nInflation 7.29% with Mining Reward per block at 8\\n\\nYear 2 - 2018\\n\\nGubiq 1.5.14 updated\\nGovernance Released — Escher token announced with 8 airdrops\\nEscher Airdrops 1 and 2\\nWhiteblock study — TL;DR Ubiq had 2X increase in throughput and 90% lower uncle rate.\\nFirst Ubiq Improvement Proposal, UIP 1 — Vote to hard fork to change to Ubqhash to mitigate 51% attack.\\nInflation 6.00% with Mining Reward per block at 7\\n\\nYear 3 - 2019\\n\\nOctano Labs Introduced-EVM support with Ubiq focus\\nEscher Airdrops 3, 4, 5 and 6\\nGubiq updates 2.1, 2.2, 2.3\\nAndromeda Hard Fork\\nInflation 4.89% with Mining Reward per block at 6\\n\\nYear 4 - 2020\\n\\nGubiq updates 3.1, 3.2\\nTornado Cash implementation\\nEscher Airdrops 7, and 8\\nUIP voted to disable Escher minting. Escher airdrops completed.\\nSpectrum Update\\nUbiq Explorer Update\\nShinobi Launch — Uniswap V.2 Fork\\nSparrow Update to use with Shinobi\\nInflation 3.91% with Mining Reward per block at 5\\n\\nAs we head into the 5th year, the infrastructure is now in place to begin building decentralized applications (dApps) and utilizing the Ubiq Ninja interface. To assist with broadening the market reach, there will be a bridge to Ethereum so that a market on Uniswap can be created. Ubiq coins will be wrapped and tokenized as wUbq and paired up with Eth, creating a wUbq/Eth market. A Dai bridge is also being evaluated so that funds can port over from various markets and wallets.\\nTo encourage liquidity growth on Shinobi, there will be Token Generating Events (TGEs) that will give Ubq/Esch liquidity providers tokens for the dApps being launched on the network by the core development team. Core Dev Julian Yap just released the following article introducing TGEs https://blog.ubiqsmart.com/launch-of-the-ubiq-token-generation-event-framework-842bd50274cd.\\nIt’s an exciting time where ideas are no longer ethereal. Liquidity in Shinobi has increased over 400% to start the new year, just breaching the $1.5 million mark. Community members and investors are now testing the staking mechanism for the TGEs as a new crop of defi participants enter the decentralized market place. The promise of decentralized networks is here and now the 4 years of infrastructure building has provided the tools and platform to realize a self-governing decentralized blockchain system.\\nHappy 4th Birthday Ubiq and cheers to promise-filled 5th year!\\n\\nHappy 4th Birthday Ubiq! was originally published in The Ubiq Report on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.","dc:creator":"J40","guid":"https://medium.com/p/cb20361db933","categories":["decentralized-exchange","bitcoin","blockchain","cryptocurrency","decentralization"],"isoDate":"2021-01-28T08:03:14.000Z","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*Yyy7u8OtBrLpNYHFddJBJA.png"},{"creator":"Julian","title":"Launch of the Ubiq Token Generation Event Framework","link":"https://blog.ubiqsmart.com/launch-of-the-ubiq-token-generation-event-framework-842bd50274cd?source=rss----e1e26a9bebc8---4","pubDate":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 07:49:50 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>The first Yield farm (a form of staking) has been launched for Ubiq.

It is issued by the underlying protocol (Bitcoin, Ethereum or Ubiq as examples) to ensure that the same number is not used twice and is there to protect the network from a <a href=\\"https://blockonomi.com/replay-attacks/\\">replay attack</a>.</p><p>For more information, here is a link to the wikipedia page.</p><p><a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce\\">Cryptographic nonce</a></p><p><strong>Nonce ordering and what happens if they get out of order?</strong></p><p>In Ubiq (as with Ethereum), each transaction you make from an account increases your nonce value by 1.</p><p>All Nonces must be in order, meaning Nonce 2 cannot be processed before Nonce 1 has been processed. The protocol will not process your transaction if you are trying to make transactions out of order.</p><p>The Nonces can get out of order if you submit a transaction with a <a href=\\"https://ethereumprice.org/gas/\\">gas</a> price too low for miners to process. For example, if you make a transaction with a Nonce value of 3 (meaning the 3rd transaction made from this account) and an insufficient gas price so this does not process, the following transactions you make will have a value of 4, 5, 6, 7… etc. Because of the way the protocol functions, these will have to process in order, meaning none of them will confirm until the 3rd transaction is fixed.</p><p><strong>How do I fix it? (Simple Version with a single broken transaction)</strong></p><p>First, make sure you have enough gas in your account to pay transaction fees.</p><p>To demonstrate how to fix this issue, I made two transactions in Sparrow. The first (nonce 114) has a Gas price of 0 GWEI (meaning the miner will earn nothing from processing the transaction (guaranteeing it will not be processed).

Whilst this is not an issue exclusive to interacting on Shinobi, we have seen an increase in the number of this type of issue, since its inception.\\nThe Parthenon, Greece\\nWhat is a Cryptographic nonce?\\nA Nonce in cryptography is an arbitrary random number created for a specific transaction that is only used once. It is issued by the underlying protocol (Bitcoin, Ethereum or Ubiq as examples) to ensure that the same number is not used twice and is there to protect the network from a replay attack.\\nFor more information, here is a link to the wikipedia page.\\nCryptographic nonce\\nNonce ordering and what happens if they get out of order?\\nIn Ubiq (as with Ethereum), each transaction you make from an account increases your nonce value by 1.\\nAll Nonces must be in order, meaning Nonce 2 cannot be processed before Nonce 1 has been processed. The protocol will not process your transaction if you are trying to make transactions out of order.\\nThe Nonces can get out of order if you submit a transaction with a gas price too low for miners to process. For example, if you make a transaction with a Nonce value of 3 (meaning the 3rd transaction made from this account) and an insufficient gas price so this does not process, the following transactions you make will have a value of 4, 5, 6, 7… etc. Because of the way the protocol functions, these will have to process in order, meaning none of them will confirm until the 3rd transaction is fixed.\\nHow do I fix it? (Simple Version with a single broken transaction)\\nFirst, make sure you have enough gas in your account to pay transaction fees.\\nTo demonstrate how to fix this issue, I made two transactions in Sparrow. The first (nonce 114) has a Gas price of 0 GWEI (meaning the miner will earn nothing from processing the transaction (guaranteeing it will not be processed). The second (nonce 115) has the current standard network gas price of 13.2 GWEI.\\nA pending transaction, nonce 114, with 0 GWEI set as the gas priceAnd the following transaction, nonce 115, with 13.2 GWEI (network default at the time) set as the gas price\\nBoth transactions are now pending and have not confirmed. The first transaction will never clear because of the gas price being set to 0 and the second transaction is unable to clear, as the protocol will not allow it to process out of order.\\nYou can see both transactions in Sparrow (and MetaMask), by clicking on Activity:\\nClick the Activity button\\nThe top transaction (nonce 114) is sitting in pending, causing the subsequent transaction to stay queued.\\nClick the ‘Speed Up’ button.\\nIn sparrow you can see both transactions, neither able to process as the nonces are out of order because of 114 not being able to process\\nYou will be presented with the ‘Customize Gas’ screen. Click ‘Advanced’.\\nThe customize gas screen\\nIn the ‘Gas Price (GWEI)’ field, enter 20 (standard gas fee), then click ‘Save’.\\nAdvanced screen for gas customization\\nThe transaction is now updated in sparrow, showing the updated gas price of 20 GWEI.\\nThe updated transaction can be viewed by clicking on the transaction under ‘activity’\\n115 will also process in the same block as 114 as there are no longer any issues preventing them from being mined.\\nNonce 114 now transacting correctly, 115 also confirmed as well now 114 has cleared\\nHow do I fix it?
